# Motion-Primitives-Solid

Beautifully designed, easy-to-integrate motion components for engineers and designers, built with motion and Tailwind CSS.

**This project is still in the testing phase, and the author is currently learning motion/react. I hope to utilize excellent animation components in upcoming Solid projects. I am collecting React components that I find outstanding and providing open-source Solid implementations in the project [motion-primitives-solid](github.com/yefu24324/motion-primitives-solid). I am exploring potential issues solid-motion may face in production-grade applications.**
